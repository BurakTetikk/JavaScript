/*

1-Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a country that speaks English, has less than 50 million people and is not an island.

2-Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her. You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.

3-If yours is the right country, log a strings like this 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('.

4-Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in Canada :D).
